Internet Socket Types: Stream Sockets, Datagram Sockets
referred as SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM

Datagram socket are sometimes called "connectionless sockets"
(Though they can be connect()’d if you really want. See connect(), below.)

Stream sockets (SOCK_STREAM) are reliable two-way connected communication streams
If you output two items into the socket in the order “1, 2”, they will arrive 
in the order “1, 2” at the opposite end.

How do stream sockets achieve this high level of data transmission quality? 
Answer: TCP makes sure your data arrives sequentially and error-free. 

IP: IP deals primarily with Internet routing and is not generally responsible for data integrity.

Datagram sockets also use IP for routing, but they don’t use TCP;
they use the “User Datagram Protocol”, or “UDP”  Well, basically, it’s because you don’t have to 
maintain an open connection as you do with stream sockets. 

They are generally used either when a 
TCP stack is unavailable or when a few dropped packets here and
there don’t mean the end of the Universe. 
Sample applications: tftp (trivial file transfer protocol, a little brother to FTP),
dhcpcd (a DHCP client), multiplayer games, streaming audio, video conferencing, etc.
